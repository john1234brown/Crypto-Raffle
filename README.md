# CryptoCurrencyRaffle
We would like to redesign the wheel as you would say everyone loves raffles but nowadays you have to physically be there and dont let get me started on how you cant buy raffle ticket with crypto so we introduce to you the very first WorldWide International CryptoCurrencyRaffle which is as easy as joining the discord server and saying hey to enter the raffle via our Discord Bot which he will ask you few questions each time you want to enter or purchase a raffle ticket.

Or with our phone app we mostly expect the most entries will be through website and discord bot.
So phone app and our software is not really in to fast of development!

Or with our Software on Windows, or using our not so graphical interface in Java for Linux or Mac

Or you can enter the raffle just by visiting our website right here > https://www.templatewebsiteblahblahblah.com,

If thats not enough to convince you well I got more to tell you we also want to create a worlds first divided raffle jackpot with multiwinners up to 10 at first and as we grow we will expand to eventually 100 to 1000 and if we reach the dream goal will have a Divided raffle jackpot of upto 100,000 people now seriously i really do want to upscale this more so come on and make this a reality.
Also we include a few free raffals you can enter to win daily NFT's we are mostly doing this to grow in popularity and build a fan base And To Prove We Are Legit!!!!

Did you think thats all i had to say nooo you thought wrong! Well anyways enough with the hype seriously though you will be able to enter the raffle via Minecraft using ForgeMod or via a Minecraft Server through a custom Inventory you access with a command. A few other video games we are going to support are Garry's Mod lame i know, Skyrim through Workshop Mod, Unturned either through a Rocket Plugin or Workshop Mod, Rust either through Server Plugin or Workshop Mod, etc.. And any other video games we might see compatability with our network in the future even include some public docs on how the minecraft server plugin works in Java and some Unturned in C#.
