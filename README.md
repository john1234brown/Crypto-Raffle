# Crypto-Raffle
We would like to redesign the wheel as you would say everyone loves raffles but nowadays you have to physically be there and dont let get me started on how you cant buy raffle ticket with crypto so we introduce to you the very first WorldWide International CryptoCurrencyRaffle which is as easy as joining the discord server and saying hey to enter the raffle via our Discord Bot which he will ask you few questions each time you want to enter or purchase a raffle ticket.

Or with our phone app we mostly expect the most entries will be through website and discord bot.
So phone app and our software is not really in to fast of development!

Or with our Software on Windows, or using our not so graphical interface in Java for Linux or Mac

Or you can enter the raffle just by visiting our website right here > https://www.templatewebsiteblahblahblah.com,

If thats not enough to convince you well I got more to tell you we also want to create a worlds first divided Decentralized Crypto Raffle Jackpot Smart Contract Chain with multiwinners up to 10 at first and as we grow we will expand to eventually 100 to 1000 and if we reach the dream goal will have a Divided raffle jackpot of upto 100,000 people now seriously i really do want to upscale this more so come on and make this a reality.
Also we include a few free raffals you can enter to win daily NFT's we are mostly doing this to grow in popularity and build a fan base And To Prove We Are Legit!!!!

Did you think thats all i had to say nooo you thought wrong! Well anyways enough with the hype seriously though you will be able to enter the raffle via Minecraft using ForgeMod or via a Minecraft Server through a custom Inventory you access with a command. A few other video games we are going to support are Garry's Mod lame i know, Skyrim through Workshop Mod, Unturned either through a Rocket Plugin or Workshop Mod, Rust either through Server Plugin or Workshop Mod, etc.. And any other video games we might see compatability with our network in the future even include some public docs on how the minecraft server plugin works in Java and some Unturned in C#.

# Update Log 11/15/2022 MM/DD/YYYY Format
# All Development has been done by @John1234brown and @JayDigsby
# A special thanks to Proxy Providers, VPN Providers. Such as ngrok, smee.io, ProtonVPN, Windscribe. Big shout out to ngrok, and smee.io, and ProtonVPN for the amazing services.
# We have a backend functional for porting to from any video game or phone app game being developed with a simple form fill out and send form fill out to api and then display the url responded from the api in said video game how ever or whatever way you please along with phone apps and such!
# Along with a payment verification system and a simple disable allowing entrys at a certain time frame function to ensure enough time to verify crypto payements before the raffle draw times or lotter number draw times.
# Additionally we have a working Lottery Ticket System the LTS will allow users to enter a lottery system which is global across either websites etc.. basically a decentralized Raffle Lottery System can be used in Video Games and Discord, anything that you can create a form input or even a command input you can have access to entering this Lottery System or the Hat Draw Raffle or the Hat Draw Raffle Multi Winners will explain further below about these



# ================== Goals ==================
# All though all this is working it still needs a few security functions put in place before public release of entries is allowed!
# For now everything is being tested and tried over and over again to ensure every user is fully Secure and to allow a Public Decentralized Blockchain of Winners Wallet Address, Payout Type, Payout Chain, Jackpot Amount, Raffle Type, Raffle Amount, and eventually a Raffle Chain
# Decentralized Raffle Blockchains, Payment and payout supported by Crypto
# Have public app that is released that will allow any user to create there own chain securely using our future website or through our Fully Functional Discord Bot which you can direct message or message it on our discord server, and eventually from within a video game! and then you run our public release of the nodes to run alot like running a crypto node but instead you will communicate with our public api with your token generated and messaged to you either by the Discord Bot, or 
# We plan on having this fully released by the new year of January 1 2023! atleast just the Entering on our Raffle chain system to test and debug things with the NFT's then we will work on the Private Chains but still can publicly enter Through our Discord bot or using or Public Release Discord Bot which you will be able to host within your server and it will communicate with ours and vice versa!
