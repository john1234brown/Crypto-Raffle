- All Development has been done by @John1234brown and https://vampeyer.github.io/
- A special thanks to Proxy Providers, VPN Providers. Such as ngrok, smee.io, ProtonVPN, Windscribe. Big shout out to ngrok, and smee.io, and ProtonVPN for the amazing services.
- We have a backend functional for porting to from any video game or phone app game being developed with a simple form fill out and send form fill out to api and then display the url responded from the api in said video game how ever or whatever way you please along with phone apps and such!
- Along with a payment verification system and a simple disable allowing entrys at a certain time frame function to ensure enough time to verify crypto payements before the raffle draw time and public disclaimer incase anyone does still access the checkout urls and pays after the timeframe instead they will be put into the next drawing! instead of lost of money seems alot more reasonable design!
- Additionally we have a working Raffle Ticket System the LTS will allow users to enter a Raffle system which is global across either websites etc.. basically a decentralized Raffle System can be used in Video Games and Discord, anything that you can create a form input or even a command input you can have access to entering this Raffle System or the Hat Draw Raffle or the Hat Draw Raffle Multi Winners will explain further below about these
- IP Checks to ensure flooded connection security to the api is complete Only logs the past 10 minutes and 1 minute IP connections and a Flagged IP for when they go above threshold and your ip will only be stored in the 10 minutes if you went above a threshold to keep a eye on your connection rate we dont permanently ban anyone or keep logs of ip address for no more then 31 days for security purposes also all Flagged IPs have a forgiveness rate every hour usually takes 2 hours if you are at flagged max increment amount which is about 600 times so usually bans only last about 2 hours at most!  
- Public Database file access will be releasing snippet codes how to get Database of all the checkout urls to be able to respond in your app or videogame to the user the url for them to visit to purchase the ticket!
- Administrator Raffle Chain Delete Function mainly for if there is any reports on a rafflechain even though we process payements if found to be connected to any illegal illicit terrorist organizations by law we have to block and deny access and delete those raffle chains so if your not doing anything with a terrorist organization then you have nothing to worry about! We will keep ALL chains alive as long as we can until we have been forced to take legal action or if proof of terrorist organization affilations have emerged!
- Website access point is almost done thanks to the one and only @Vampeyer he is also busy designing his Lottery Ticket Website!
